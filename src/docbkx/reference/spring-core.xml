  <title>C24 IO support for Spring</title>

  <abstract>
    <para>C24 IO can be integrated into several of the core Spring Framework
    features as well. C24 IO plugs into Spring-WS for SOAP based services,
    replacing the XML marshalling framework. If plugs into Spring MVC for
    building REST interfaces using C24 IO marshalling and unmarshalling,
    allowing any C24 IO supported data type to be passed seamlessly over
    REST/HTTP.</para>
